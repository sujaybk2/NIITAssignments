A grocery store gives a 5% discount on the total bill to a customer who has purchased products of more than $500.

Algorithm:
Step 1- Start
Step 2- Read  input for input1 (customer's purchase amount )
Step 3- If input1 is greater than or equal to 500, go to step 4. Else, go to step 5.
Step 4- Calculate Output = input1 * (0.05 +input1), and then jump to step 6 // Give 5% discount.
Step 5 - Calculate Output = input1
Step 6 - Print the Output
Step 7 - Stop

Pseudocode:
Begin
    Input input1
        If(input1 >= 500)
    Output = input1 * (0.05 +input1)
         Else
         Output = input1
Print Output
End
